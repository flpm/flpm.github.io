### Reading and listening to

- (paperback) Rescuing Socrates, by Roosevelt Mont√°s
- (audiobook) 36 Books That Changed the Word (The Great Courses)

### Working on

- The new website: working on a way to automate content publishing so I can write from my phone and have the site updated with minimal interaction.
- Bookshelf project: working on cataloguing the books and audiobooks I own and mapping them to a timeline.

### Current interests

- I have been very interested lately on linguistics, grammar, and writing.
- I continue to (slowly) learn Latin.
- I have also read a little about Liberal Arts education.
