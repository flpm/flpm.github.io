### Reading and listening to

- (paperback) Rescuing Socrates, by Roosevelt Mont√°s
- (audiobook) The Skeptic's Guide to Great Books (The Great Courses), by Grant L. Voth

### Working on

- The new website: working on a way to automate content publishing so I can write from my phone and have the site updated with minimal interaction.
- Bookshelf project: working on cataloguing and mapping the books and audiobooks I own to a timeline.

### Current interests

- I have been very interested lately on linguistics, grammar, and writing.
- I continue to (slowly) learn Latin.
- I have also read a little about Liberal Arts education.
