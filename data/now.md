### Reading and listening to

- (paperback) [Rescuing Socrates](/books/info/9780691224398/) by Roosevelt Montás
- (paperback) [Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands](/books/info/9780143126676/) by Judith Schalansky

### Working on

- Bookshelf project: continuing with the work to compile a catalog of my books and audiobooks. I am reading and reflecting a lot about books: how people find them, why they buy them, how they choose to organize them, and how they interact with them.

### Current interests

- I am very interested in linguistics: grammar, reading and writing.
- I have been trying to write more.
- I continue to learn Latin.
