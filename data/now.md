### Reading and listening to

- (paperback) [Rescuing Socrates](/books/info/9780691224398/) by Roosevelt Montás
- (paperback) [Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands](/books/info/9780143126676/) by Judith Schalansky

### Working on

- Bookshelf project: continuing with the work to compile a catalog of my books. Currently I am refining the schema, writing a Python CLI app to automate the process, and designing the indexes.
- Playing around with GitHub Copilot: I have been using Copilot for writing JavaScript and Python for the Bookshelf project, it has been a very interesting and positive experience.

### Current interests

- I have been very interested lately on linguistics, grammar, and writing.
- I continue to (slowly) learn Latin.
- I have also read a little about Liberal Arts education.
