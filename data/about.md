### Current work

I'm an experienced security professional with a strong background in Python software development, data science and design. Currently, I lead the Security Data Science team at Bloomberg LP, where we develop new and efficient ways to use data to improve security processes.

Right now my focus is on improving situational awareness, finding ways to help security analysts and engineers make faster and more accurate security decisions by providing them contextual information.

### Before

Before joining Bloomberg, I worked as a consultant performing penetration tests, security reviews and teaching developers how to make their code more secure.
