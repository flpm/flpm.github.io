### Jenny Odell

[Jenny Odell](https://www.jennyodell.com/) is an artist and writer based in Oakland, California. Her book [How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy](https://www.jennyodell.com/book) (Melville House, 2019) was the best book I read in 2023. 

You should also check some of her art projects, like the [Bureau of Suspended Objects](https://www.jennyodell.com/bso.html) where she documented the context of objects found in garbage and [Neo Surreal](https://www.jennyodell.com/neosurreal.html), where she selected images from 80's Byte Magazine advertisements and recontextualized them.


### Maggie Appleton

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) is a designer and anthropologist. Her article about Digital Gardens, [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) got me started thinking about the nature of the modern Web and was a big influence in the design of this site.


### Maria Popova

Maria Popova's [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org) site has been a recurring source of inspiration and interesting references. Her essays often lead me to new books and authors.

In [Becoming the Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/) she reflects about the site and her writing at the ocasion of the site renaming from Brain Pickings to The Marginalian.

Other posts you can take a look:
- [Richard Dawkins on the Luckiness of Death](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/)
- [Wintering: Resilience, the Wisdom of Sadness, and How the Science of Trees Illuminates the Art of Self-Renewal Through Difficult Times](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/06/wintering-katherine-may/)
- [How to Keep Life from Becoming a Parody of Itself: Simone de Beauvoir on the Art of Growing Older](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/07/31/simone-de-beauvoir-coming-of-age/)


### James Somers

[James Somers](https://jsomers.net/) is a writer and programmer. He writes about thecnology in publications like the New Yorker and the Atlantic and his [blog](https://jsomers.net/blog/) is filled with interesting short posts about a variety of interesting topics.

His article [A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft) in the 2023 issue of the New Yorker dedicate to AI is a good introduction.

And I ended up buying the book [Field Notes on Science & Nature](http://localhost:3000/books/info/9780674057579/) because of one of his posts, [More people should write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write).
