This site is my personal digital garden. It contains my side
[projects](/projects) and [notes](/notes). You can also find more
[about](/about) me and what I am up to [now](/now).

The notes are constantly evolving and are often a work in progress.
I keep track of when I originally created them and the last time I
modified them.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), an open-source app, to write and publish content to
the site via GitHub. If you are curious about how it all works, take
a peek [behind the scenes](/how_it_works).

The ideas on this site are my own and do not reflect the opinion of my employer.
