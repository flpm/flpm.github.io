I work in the intersection of software engineering, information security and design.

This site contains my side
[projects](/projects) and notes. You can also find more
[about](/about) me and what I am up to [now](/now).

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), an open-source app, to write and publish content to
the site via GitHub. If you are curious about how it all works, take
a peek [behind the scenes](/notes/colophon).

The ideas on this site are my own and do not reflect the opinion of my employer.
