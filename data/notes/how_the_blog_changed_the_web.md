These are my notes about the article [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy?lang=en). It reflects on how the web changed from static and curated homepages to dynamic and chronological news feeds. You should click on the link and go read the original article.

The web was very different when it first became popular in the late 90's and much, much smaller.

> Back in the day when the Web had a capital letter [and the Internet was] so small that it was conceivable that one could maintain a list of every site

The web of the 90's was based on a different metaphor: the table of contents. The table of contents is a static element that can change but evolves at a much smaller pace than the "news feed" metaphor that defines today's web. Back then web content aged slowly and was meant to last longer.

> Dates didn't matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older Content remained in view too, because the dominant metaphor was the table of contents rather than diary entry.
>  
> Everyone with a homepage became a de facto amateur reference librarian.

Along with the table of contents metaphor came another metaphor: the user as a librarian. The web was about curation and the role of the author was to gather, create and organize content in a way that made sense to them.

> Homepages had a timeless quality, an index of interesting or useful or relevant things about a topic or about a person.

This curation was a key process in the early web of personal homepages since the authors choices of what to link to helped surface quality content.

The Google's founders were able to revolutionize the web back then using PageRank, its original search algorithm, because they found a way to leverage this 'curation' process to estimate the value of a page. A page appears more prominently in the search result if more pages link to it.

As the web evolved and the the "table of contents" metaphor was replaces with the "news feed" metaphor we have today (first with the blog and the with social media), the value provided by the PageRank approach declined. Google would eventually replace it by a completely different approach in the mid 2000's.

> In 94, a college student named Justin Hall broke free from the table of contents format [...] Justin's Links became the first daily web diary.

> [At first] chronological content was in the minority [...] Not everyone had the desire to publish [their personal life] [...] and diarying was a helluva lof of work.

Even after the initial blogging platforms came out, the diary format was not the dominant format, the web was still mostly about thematic content instead of status updates.

> And things didn't change immediately when Blogger and LiveJournal appeared on the scene in 99 [...] Neither was an immediate success.

The friction to create the chronological content was still very high and the interest to do so was not yet high enough to justify the effort. It would all change eventually, when the blog platforms came out to make that process easier.

> The real movement came in 2001 [...] MovableType [...] was the first powerful one that appealed to tweakers, the do-it-yourselfers, the webmonkeys.

MovebleType was the first content management system you could download for free. It both reduced the friction to create content and allowed people to customize and make their site their own. That was a powerful combination.

It changed the creation process from the artisanal manufacturing of HTML pages to a streamlined process where the user could focus on the content only. The simplicity of the stream format with content ordered in reverse chronological order also made it possible to bypass the need to create structures and hierarchies, so there was no need to spend time organizing the content.

> When something is easy people will do more of it.

That simplification process would only accelerate over time and trade creative freedom in exchange for speed. Later on Twitter would even limit the size of the content to 140 characters. It was an inevitable process of creativity erosion.

> The form followed the function slavishly [...] thus began the chronological sort era. [...] They soon learned that the chronostream was a decent servant, but a terrible master.

> Today these social publishing tools are beginning to buck reverse chronological order; they are inroducing algorithm sort, taking away even the control to decide what you want to see.

This whole story is about the loss of control and a gradual erosion of our ability to create, display, and interact with content. You surrender everything and accept that the platform will manage it for you, with your best interest in mind. But the goal is no longer to help you create, it is to keep you engaged for as a long as possible so you can be served ads.

> There are no more quirky homepages. There are no more amateur librarians.
