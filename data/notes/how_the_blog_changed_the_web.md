These are my notes about the article [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy?lang=en). It reflects on how the web changed from static and curated homepages to dynamic and chronological news feeds. You should click on the link and go read the original article.

The web was very different when it first became popular in the late 90's and it was much, much smaller.

> Back in the day when the Web had a capital letter [and the Internet was] so small that it was conceivable that one could maintain a list of every site

The web of the 90's was based on a different metaphor: the table of contents, a static element that can change, but evolves at a much smaller pace than the "news feed" that defines today's web. Back then, the web content aged slowly and was meant to last longer.

> Dates didn't matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older Content remained in view too, because the dominant metaphor was the table of contents rather than diary entry.
>  
> Everyone with a homepage became a de facto amateur reference librarian.

Along with the table of contents metaphor came another metaphor: the user as a librarian. The web was about curation and the role of the author of a page was to gather, create and organize content in a way that made sense to them.

> Homepages had a timeless quality, an index of interesting or useful or relevant things about a topic or about a person.

This curation was a key process in the early web of personal homepages since the authors choices of what to include or link to helped surface quality content.

Google was able to revolutionize the web back then because they found a way to leverage this 'curation' process (using PageRank) to estimate the value of a page. A page appears more prominently in the search result if more pages link to it, if more curators have selected it.

As the web evolved, the "table of contents" metaphor was replaced with the "news feed" metaphor we have today (first by the blog and then with social media platforms). With that evolution, the value provided by the PageRank declined and Google was force to eventually replace it by a completely different approach by the mid 2000's.

> In 94, a college student named Justin Hall broke free from the table of contents format [...] Justin's Links became the first daily web diary.

> [At first] chronological content was in the minority [...] Not everyone had the desire to publish [their personal life] [...] and diarying was a helluva lof of work.

Even after the initial blogging platforms came out, the diary format was not the dominant format, the web was still mostly about thematic content instead of status updates.

> And things didn't change immediately when Blogger and LiveJournal appeared on the scene in 99 [...] Neither was an immediate success.

The friction to create the chronological content was still high and the interest to do so was not yet high enough to justify the effort. It would all change eventually, when better blog platforms came out and started to appeal to the power users who owned the homepages. 

> The real movement came in 2001 [...] MovableType [...] was the first powerful one that appealed to tweakers, the do-it-yourselfers, the webmonkeys.

MovebleType was the first content management system you could download for free. It reduced the friction to create content and allowed people to make their site their own. That was a powerful combination.

It changed the creation process from the artisanal manufacturing of HTML pages to a streamlined process where the user could focus on the content only. The simplicity of the stream format with content ordered in reverse chronological order also made it possible to bypass the need to create structures and hierarchies, so there was no need to spend time organizing the content.

> When something is easy people will do more of it.

That simplification process would only accelerate over time and continue to trade creative freedom in exchange for convenience. Later on, Twitter would even limit the size of the content to 140 characters. It was an inevitable erosion of the creative process.

> The form followed the function slavishly [...] thus began the chronological sort era. [...] They soon learned that the chronostream was a decent servant, but a terrible master.

> Today these social publishing tools are beginning to buck reverse chronological order; they are inroducing algorithm sort, taking away even the control to decide what you want to see.

This whole story is about the gradual loss of control and our ability to create, display, and interact with content. In the current web you surrender everything and accept that the platform will manage your content and your interactions with other content for you. But the platofms does not have you interests in mind, their main goal is to keep you engaged, as often as possible and for as a long as possible, you can be served ads.

> There are no more quirky homepages. There are no more amateur librarians.
