I was thinking about what to say to you all today to summarize the work
with did last year. What was the most important thing we did? But I
could not think of one particular feature or release that explained why
so many more people were now using Praxis. Then I realized it was not
about what we did but how we chose to do it. If we want to impact the
company's security, we must do that through our users. And if we want to
have a chance to do that, we need to create an application that people
want to use it.

To do that, we need to know what you need. And we could not have done
that this year if you had not given us a chance by using Praxis,
providing feedback, and sending suggestions of features that would make
your life easier. So you were the most significant factor that helped
improve Praxis in 2022. 2022 was the year Praxis went mainstream.
