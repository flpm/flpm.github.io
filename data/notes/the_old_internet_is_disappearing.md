These are my notes about the article [The Internet that took over the Internet](http://petermolnar.net/journal/internet-emotional-core/), by [Peter Molnar](http://petermolnar.net/).

This article references [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy?lang=en), which I have written about in [How the blog changed the web](/notes/how_the_blog_changed_the_web).

>  If you look deep enough, beneath mountains of attention hoarding, illusion photography, trending trends, you'll find the old Internet, the one with content, knowledge, individuality, but you need to look hard. Can it be saved? 


> Most of the content was hand crafted, arranged to be readable, not searchable; it was human first, not machine first. Nearly everything online had a lot of effort put into it, even if the result was eye-blowing red text on blue background.

The homepages in the early web had a non-linear structure, the organization of the content required work and a navigation structure to guide readers through it. There was no automated process for this, if you wanted to create a page you had to do it yourself, by hand.

> We used to have homepages. Homes on the Internet. Not profiles, no; profile is something the authorities make about you in dossier.

This analogy touches the same point of control and ownership of the content that is at the center of today's web. A homepage was something you own, a profile is something that is created about you. This is a very interesting analogy: authorities create a profile about you, and so do the platforms where we post content today. There is a clear asymmetry of power.

> [...] the carefully laboured web 1.0, had already went underground when tools made it simple for anyone to publish with just a few clicks.

The key evolution between the early web and the blogs and social networks of "web 2.0" platforms made was the trade off between creative control and freedon for an easy way to publish content.

> [...] the true way out of the swamp of social media is for things to require a little effort. To make people think about what they produce, to make them connect to their online content.

I feel conflicted about this because technical barriers should not prevent people that has something to say or share from doing so. But at the same time, the barriers do play a role in the quality of the content that is produced. By imposing a small cost to the creation of content, you filter out the users who are not willing to make the effort. If it costed 10 cents to send an email, spam might not exist.

> At this point in time, most people don't seem to relate to their online content. It's expendable. We need to make them care about it, and simpler tooling, on it's own, will not help with the lack of emotional connection.

Content used to last longer, it was not ephemeral, it did not disappeared from your sight (newsfeed) in a matter of hours. The internet was slower and the content was meant to last longer. Today with the pressure to produce more and more at faster and faster pace, we are losing that connection.

This has to do with the attention economy and the fact that the platforms are designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible. The goal is not the content, that is secondary, the goal is to keep you distracted with your attention on the platform so you can be monetized.
