These are my notes about the article [The Internet that took over the Internet](http://petermolnar.net/journal/internet-emotional-core/), by [Peter Molnar](http://petermolnar.net/).

This article references [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy?lang=en), which I have written about in [How the blog changed the web](/notes/how_the_blog_changed_the_web).

>  If you look deep enough, beneath mountains of attention hoarding, illusion photography, trending trends, you'll find the old Internet, the one with content, knowledge, individuality, but you need to look hard. Can it be saved? 

> Most of the content was hand crafted, arranged to be readable, not searchable; it was human first, not machine first. Nearly everything online had a lot of effort put into it, even if the result was eye-blowing red text on blue background.

The homepages in the early web had a non-linear structure. The organization of the content required work and a navigation structure to guide readers through it. There was no automated process for this, if you wanted to create a page, you had to do it yourself, by hand.

> We used to have homepages. Homes on the Internet. Not profiles, no; profile is something the authorities make about you in dossier.

This analogy hints at the same issue of control and ownership of content at the center of today's web. A homepage was something you owned, a profile is something that is created about you. Authorities and the web platforms of today create a profile about you: there is a clear asymmetry of power.

> [...] the carefully laboured web 1.0, had already went underground when tools made it simple for anyone to publish with just a few clicks.

The key evolution between the early web and the blogs and social networks of the "web 2.0" platforms was a trade of creative control and freedon for an easy way to publish content.

> [...] the true way out of the swamp of social media is for things to require a little effort. To make people think about what they produce, to make them connect to their online content.

I feel conflicted about this because technical barriers should not prevent people that have something to say from doing so. At the same time, such barriers sometimes play a role in improving the quality of the content that is produced. By imposing a small cost (in effort) to the creation and publishing of content, they filter out the users who are not willing to make the effort. If it costed 10 cents to send an email, maybe spam would not be such a problem.

> At this point in time, most people don't seem to relate to their online content. It's expendable. We need to make them care about it, and simpler tooling, on it's own, will not help with the lack of emotional connection.

Content used to last longer, it was not ephemeral, it did not disappeared from your sight (your newsfeed) in a matter of hours. The internet was slower and the content was meant to last longer. Today with the pressure to produce more and at a faster pace, we are losing that connection.

This acceleration benefit the attention economy and the fact that the platforms are designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible is a big incentive to keep it going. The goal is no longer the value of the content, that is secondary, the goal is to people engaged, keep their eyes on the platform, where that attention can be monetized with ads.
