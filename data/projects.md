Currently, I am working on the following projects:

### Bookshelf catalogue

I am compiling a list of all the physical books and audiobooks. I will correlate this list with data from Amazon purchases and my Audible purchase and listening history to create a timeline of interests and subjects. I am also working on a way to display this data on the site.

### New website

I am working on a new version of this site. I am using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build it. I am also working on a way to automate content publishing so I can write from my phone and have the site updated with minimal interaction. You can find more details on the [colophon](/notes/colophon) page.
