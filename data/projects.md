Currently, I am working on the following projects:

### Bookshelf catalogue

I am compiling a list of all the physical books and audiobooks I own. My plan is to correlate this list with data from Amazon purchases and Audible's purchase and listening history to create a timeline of interests and subjects. I am also working on a way to display this data on the site.

### New website

I am working on the new version of this site (what you are looking at right now). I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build it. The code building and deployment is automated using GitHub Actions, so I can write content on my phone and have the site updated with minimal interaction. You can find more details about how it works on the [colophon](/notes/colophon) page.
