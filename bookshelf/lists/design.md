I have been interested in Design since the early 2000s, when I moved from Paris to New York. Around that time I enrolled into Continuing Educations classes in the School of Visual Arts and took a few classes in Graphic Design, Typography, and Information Design. My library grew considerably since then with books about different aspects of Design.
