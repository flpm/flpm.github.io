Graded Go Problems for Beginners are ideal books for players who have just learned the rules of go, bridging the gap between a beginner's book and some of the more 'advanced' elementary book. The almost 1500 problems these four volumes contain thoroughly drill the reader in the fundamentals of the game. After finishing the study of these four books, The novice go player will have mastered the basics of the game. Volume Two is a continuation of the first volume of Graded Go Problems for Beginners and is aimed at the 20-kyu to 25-kyu level player. The problems presented here will require a bit of thought, but none of them is so difficult that a player who understands the rules and has studied the first volume won't be able to solve in less than a minute. The aim of this series is to present as many examples of go technique as possible. The reader should attempt to refute the correct answers until he knows beyond a doubt that the correct answer works. By pondering each problem in this way, the reader will develop an instinct for finding the winning move in his games.
