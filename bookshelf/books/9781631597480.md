The text and accompanying photos and graphics of this classic resource are delivered in a concise and accessible format perfect for designers, educators, and students. This new, expanded edition includes updated information on scenarios, secondary research, territory maps, and other chapters. The addition of 25 new chapters brings fresh relevance to the text with innovative design methods that have emerged since the first edition, such as backcasting, behavioral design, horizon scanning, and transition design.

Each method is presented in a two-page format. The left-hand page contains a concise description of the method, accompanied by references to further reading. On the right-hand page, images and case studies for each method are presented visually. The relevant phases for design application are highlighted as numbered icons along the right side of the page, from phases 1 (planning, scoping, and definition) through 5 (launch and monitor).
