The present pages are intended as a supplement to the writer's treatise on Modern Magic, which made its first appearance in 1878. It has run through six editions, and still maintains its position as the standard authority on the subject, but the knowing in such matters begin to complain that it is not quite up to date. Conjuring, like other arts, has been " moving on " during the past eleven years. Old methods have been improved, and new have been devised. "Eternal progress is eternal change," and the "how it's done" of 1889 differs, in a good many particulars, from the "how it used to be done" of 1878. To incorporate these later developments of the Mystic Art with Modern Magic itself would render it inconveniently bulky, and it has, therefore, been decided to embody them in a supplementary treatise, under the title of More Magic. The explanations to be here given will pre-suppose an acquaintance with Modern Magic, to which, in order to avoid repetition, I shall have frequent occasion to refer. With regard to the order of treatment, I have thought it well to follow, as nearly as possible, the arrangement of the original work. Professor Hoffmann
