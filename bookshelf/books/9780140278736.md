Having got rid of their human master, the animals of Manor Farm look forward to a life of freedom and plenty. But as a clever, ruthless elite among them takes control, the other animals find themselves hopelessly ensnared in the old ways. Orwell's chilling story of the betrayal of idealism through tyranny and corruption is as fresh and relevant today as when it was first published in 1945. 'One of the greatest political fables of all time... It is the book for everyone and Everyman, its brightness undimmed after 50 years' Ruth Rendell, Daily Telegraph
