This book is written for players who have acquired an understanding of the

rules of go and some of its most elementary tactics and strategies by having read

an introductory book and having played a few games. We have assumed that the

reader understands the terms 'sente' and 'gote', that he knows what a ko is, is

able to determine neutral points, and can count the score. Its aim is to give the

novice an introduction to each phase of the game and to dispel a number of strategic

and tactical misconceptions that often plague beginners and inhibit their

progress.

Beginners usually overemphasize defense, not realizing that the best way to

defend is to attack. By attacking your opponent's stones, you can often defend

your weak positions in the process. Understanding this concept from the very beginning

of one's go career will clear the way for quick progress up through the

kyu ranks. In this context, Chapters Two and Four are the most important and

should be of value, especially to players who have been struggling for years to

reach expert or dan level.
