Hans Ørberg's Lingua Latina per se Illustrata is the world's premiere textbook for learning Latin via the Natural Method. Students first learn grammar and vocabulary intuitively through extended contextual reading and an innovative system of marginal notes. It is the only textbook currently available that gives students the opportunity to learn Latin without resorting to translation, but allows them to think in the language. It is also the most popular text for teachers, at both the secondary and collegiate levels, who wish to incorporate conversational skills into their classroom practice.

Part I, Familia Romana contains thirty-five chapters and describes the life of a Roman family in the 2nd century A.D., and culminate in readings from classical poets and Donatus' Ars Grammatica, the standard Latin school text for a millennium.

The book includes a table of inflections, a Roman calendar, and a word index, index vocabulorum.
