In dim forgotten recesses of the world lurk mind-twisting horrors. Through the use of human agents these horrors work to thwart mankind's destiny.However, not all of these human agents are willing partners. Many times have the monsters resorted to subtlety and intrigue to further their ends, rather than gross displays of sheer destruction.

Andrew Keetling is one such unwilling agent. A successful Boston businessman, he has disappeared -- held captive in a mansion of madness.

"Mansions Of Madness" is a new collection of five independent tales set in the 1920s. Of varying length and complexity, these adventures can be planted into an ongoing campaign as the keeper sees fit. Some can be played in a single night; others will require several nights to complete. They can readily be used as plot twists, interesting diversions or red herrings.
