The spiffy adventures of McConey (Les formidables aventures de Lapinot in the original French language) is a comic series by the popular French cartoonist Lewis Trondheim.

The series mixes satire and fantasy. The main characters are all animals: for instance McConey (Lapinot) is a shy and easygoing rabbit, while Richard is an engaging cat with a loud mouth and a knack for getting into trouble.

The stories alternate between modern France and stock historical settings. The recurring characters in the series can be thought of as actors who don't always play the same people, but always play the same type of roles. The series is generally unpredictable: each book is different in terms of pace, plot, theme, etc.

Out of the ten official volumes of the series, only two have been translated in English.
