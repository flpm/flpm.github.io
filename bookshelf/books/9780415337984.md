Nigel Warburton brings philosophy to life with an imaginative selection of philosophical writings on key topics. Philosophy: Basic Readings is the ideal introduction to some of the most accessible and thought-provoking pieces in philosophy, both contemporary and classic.

The second edition of Philosophy: Basic Readings has been expanded to include new pieces in each major area of philosophy:

- What is philosophy?

- God

- Right and wrong

- The external world

- Science

- Mind

- Art

The readings in Philosophy: Basic Readings complement the chapters in Philosophy: The Basics (4th edition 2004).
