Take your spellcasters to limits they have never reached before! With over two hundred new spells and magical items, the Tome of Magic stretches the horizons of every wizard and priest in the AD&D 2nd Edition game.

In these pages are new forms of wizard magic including elementalists, metamagic, and wild magic, plus expansions of existing schools. For priests, whole new spheres have been discovered - spheres of chaos, law, numbers, thought, time, war, and wards - and powerful new quest spells lie waiting to be tapped.

All characters will experience the thrill of discovering new magical items such as the claw of magic stealing, dimensional mine, crystal parrot, ring of randomness, and staff of the elements. Tome of Magic is an invaluable expansion for all the spellcasting classes.
